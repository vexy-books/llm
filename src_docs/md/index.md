# The Vexy Book of Large Language Models

*A practical guide to LLMs, RAG, agents, and APIs in late 2025*

## What This Book Covers

Language models went from research curiosity to essential infrastructure in less than three years. This book cuts through the hype to show you what actually works.

**Part I: The Landscape** - Provider selection, economics, and the state of LLMs in late 2025.

**Part II: The Arsenal** - Free APIs, 122+ Python packages, CLI tools, and the MCP protocol.

**Part III: Building Things** - RAG architectures, embeddings, and agent design patterns.

**Part IV: Case Studies** - Three projects from concept to deployment.

**Part V: The Smart Money** - Subscriptions, cost optimization, and future directions.
