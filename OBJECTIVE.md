Your job is to write "The Vexy Book of Large Language Models". Research Claude Code CLI scaffolding for an ambitious long-running project, and into `.claude` folder implement such scaffolding: multiple agents, multiple skills etc. Then analyze the @./private/ . Note that inside the @./private/private/ is LARGE AND EXTENSIVE and you should consult it judiciously. But @./private/private6.txt is your friend: it’s a map of the whole thing, list of all paths inside @./private/private/ and micro-TLDRs. Oh, @./private/private2/ is a file-by-file TLDR or @./private/private/ (so each file in private2 is the TLDR of the corresponding file in private. You need to describe all this into @./README.md of the project and then update @./CLAUDE.md to refernece it, and then PLAN the PLANNING. That is: before we WRITE the book, we need to PLAN the book. For that we need to read @./private/private6.txt and then make a PLAN of READING the various parts of @./private/private2/ and @./private/private/ . And then we should PLAN how we arrive at the TLDR. For the book, the RULES OF PROSE WRITING are absolutely key. And MANY MANY iterations of planning, executing, reviewing, reflecting, refining, revising. Our goal is that "The Vexy Book of Large Language Models" is an very accessible, humorous, yet accurate (as of December 2025) and actionable guide about LLMs, MCP servers, RAG, existing LLM API providers (esp. free and cheap ones), existing LLM inference & agentic framework (especially focused on Python). Inside the vast vault of @./private/private/ are already "minibooks" and researches and code examples for all that. Your job is to correctly identify these sources, organize references to these sources into logical portions (structured like the book). Then you need to come up with 2-3 practical cast studies (should at least remotely have something to do with Vexy Lines or FontLab or typography or graphic design, but should also be "cool" and somewhat funny and lightweight). We want the book to also pack some emotional punch, and have some "crime thriller"-like / adventure novel-like narrative threads and elements as we are on the search for "the best" solutions.  

When you work and you think we need illustrations, make faux Markdown image references with the pattern `![alt text contains prompt](https://pixy.vexy.art/)` — pixy.vexy.art will be our image generator. 

Oh, one more thing. ./zensical-guide.md contains a technical guide for deploying zensical. Analyze @./src_docs/md and @./zensical.toml to understand how the book is expected to be strucured and deployed. 

So, your goal is to re-use, adapt, consolidate as much as possible from @./private/ into @./src_docs/ — but first you need to plan the planning of the planning of the implementation, then plan the planning of the implementation, then plan the implementation, and then implement. And then revise, reflect, ultrathink, review, refine. 

Write your own tools. Develop your own skills. Be the best literary technical writer who loves LLMs for coding and writing. Make it useful, humorous, engaging, suspensful, technicaly sound, precise, accurate, truthful, interesting.

## RULES OF PROSE WRITING

## Hook and hold

- **First line sells the second line** – No throat-clearing
- **Enter late, leave early** – Start in action, end before over-explaining
- **Conflict creates interest** – What's at stake?

## Clarity above all

- **Embrace plain language** – Never use "utilize" when "use" works. Clarity is kindness to your reader
- **No corporate jargon** – Clear, concrete language only
- **Use active voice and strong verbs** – "John slammed the door" beats "The door was slammed by John"
- **Omit needless words** – Every sentence should either reveal character or advance action. If it doesn't, cut it

## Show, don’t tell

- **Show through action, not exposition** – Instead of "Sarah was nervous," write "Sarah picked at her cuticles until they bled"
- **Use specific details, not generic descriptions** – "A 1973 Plymouth Duster with a cracked windshield" beats "an old car"
- **Trust the reader's intelligence** – Stop explaining what you've just shown. Your reader doesn't need training wheels

## Focus your impact

- **One person, one problem** – Specific beats generic
- **Write for one reader, not everyone** – Pick your ideal reader and ignore everyone else
- **Transformation over features** – Show the change, not the tool

## Edit without mercy

- **Kill your darlings** – If it doesn't serve the reader, delete it
- **Skepticism is healthy** – Question everything, including this guide
- **Light humor allowed** – But clarity comes first

## Sell gently

- **Pain before gain** – Start with the problem they feel today, not the solution you're selling
- **Benefits trump features** – "Sleep through the night" beats "memory foam with 3-inch density"
- **Social proof early** – Third-party validation in the first third builds trust faster than any claim

## Explain clearly

- **Lead with the outcome** – Tell them what they'll accomplish before how to accomplish it
- **Progressive disclosure** – Basic usage first, advanced options later, edge cases last
- **Error messages are UX** – Write them like helpful directions, not system diagnostics

**The golden rule**: If the reader has to read it twice, you've failed once.
